# MTXGraphParser
## Description
[MTXGraphParser] is a specialized tool designed for converting MTX (Matrix Market format) graphs into plain edge-list graphs. 
This project aims to simplify the process of handling MTX graph data, making it more accessible and usable in various applications that require edge-list formats.

## Features
MTX Graph Reading: Efficiently reads MTX graph files.
Edge-List Conversion: Converts MTX graphs to a plain edge-list format.
Graph Connectivity: Offers the feature to make the graph connected if the number of components is greater than one, ensuring a unified graph structure for further analysis or processing.

## Getting Started
### Installation
